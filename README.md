# Music Shop

A React shopping cart project built as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-shopping-cart). This is the first React project where I fully committed to designing the interface myself and polishing the look and feel.

## Overview

The goal of the assignment was to apply the React concepts covered so far. I decided to put extra effort into design and layout, especially responsive behavior across screen sizes. Making the interface work well on both mobile and desktop took the most time, since this was my first attempt at creating a fully responsive layout.

## What I Learned

### React Fundamentals
- Fetching and displaying data within components  
- Navigation with React Router  
- Passing data through Outlet context to avoid prop drilling  
- Handling error pages  
- Using PropTypes for component validation  

### Testing
- Writing basic component tests  
- Understanding what to test without focusing on implementation details  
- Working through the challenges of mocking external behavior  

### Styling and Design
- Building a complete responsive design from scratch  
- Refining layouts for different screen sizes  
- Using CSS modules to scope styles to individual components  

### Reflection
React itself felt approachable since I already had experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The real challenge was in creating a clean, responsive interface. Once I improve in both frontend and backend, I plan to take a UI/UX course to better understand how to create designs that work well for a wider audience.
